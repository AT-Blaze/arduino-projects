# LCDKeypadRadio Example

This example allows controlling the a supported radio chip by using the LCDKeypad Shield
stacked on a Arduino UNO board.

It is designed for Arduino UNO only.

You have to modify the source code line where the radio variable is defined to the chip you use.
There are out-commented lines for every chip in the sketch.

Be sure to activate the lines for the RST signal for SI4703 radio chips.

Please read the README.md files in the TEST____ examples for more chip specific hints.

There is a picture of this setup with a RDA5807 chip available at <https://homeding.github.io/elements/audio/rda5807.htm>
